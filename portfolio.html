    <left><p>Taco 'Bout a Maze!</p></left>
<ul>
  <li>We changed the layout of the maze, the color of the ball, and what the goal ends up saying when you reach it. We also added two extra sprites (the blue troll and the taco). In addition, we managed to code out a point system!</li1>

  <li>This is our remake of Goldilocks and the Three Bears on Scratch! Press the green flag to start! To move Goldilocks, press the left and right arrow keys. The story is interactive, so whenever Goldilocks comes across a choice to make, help her out! When you're done with a scene, press the arrow on the top right to go to the next one. Have fun!</li>

        <left><p>App Inventor Hurl Pad</p></left>
    <li>This is the app my partner, Nicholas, and I created using App Inventor. This is a DJ pad with buttons that the user can click on. Each button plays a different sound, and the buttons also change colors when they are clicked on. On the right side of the screen, there are four extra buttons for pre-set beats. The user can simply click one of these buttons, and a beat will play. The user can then add on to these beats. On the bottom of the screen is an image sprite of a DJ letting the user know how to use the app. We hope you have fun with this!</li>
